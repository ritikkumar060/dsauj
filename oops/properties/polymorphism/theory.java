    // types of polymorphism-
    // 1.compile time/static polymorphism:-achieved via method overloading
    //2. Run time/dynamic polymorphism:- Achieved by the method overriding

    // final keyword : if a method is final then you can not override it (Early binding) 
    // if a class is final then the methods of that class will be fianl too

    // static method can be inherited but can not be overriden
