public class theory {
// inheritance is the process of inheriting the properties of parent class by the child class
// there are four types inheritance that the java supports
//1. sigle level inheritance
//2. multi level inheritance
//3. hierarchical inheritance
//4. hybrid inheritance :- combination of single level and multilevel inheritance
// there is a special type of inheritance (multiple inheritance) that is not allowed in java, but it cna be achieved by the implementation of the interfaces

    // to inherit a class the extend keyword is used 
    // to inherit a interface the implements keyword is used

    // If a class is final then it cannot be inherited by other child class
